# Lines that start with '#' are comments and are ignored by Python.

#Exercise 1.A
#Write your answers in the line below the question number. Your answers should be enclosed in a print command, e.g. print(``6 September 1978'')

#A(i)

#A(ii)

#A(iii)

#A(iv)


#Exercise 1.B
#Your answers should be enclosed in a print command, e.g. print(list(range(10))). Do not touch the lines of code defining a,b,x,y,
#but write your answers in the lines after them.

#B(i)

#B(ii)

#B(iii)
a = list(range(70,1030,3))

#B(iv)
b = list(range(-41,10))

#B(v)


#B(vi)
x,y = [1,3,5],[2,4,6]
